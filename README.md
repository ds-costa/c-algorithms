# c-algorithms (Because c is cool)

## Prerequisites

Linux - Things you need to compile and use the libraries:

- gcc Compiler
```bash
$> sudo apt install gcc 
```
- build-essential package
```bash
$> sudo apt install build-essential 
```
- make
```bash
$> sudo apt install make 
```
- cmake
```bash
$> sudo apt install cmake 
```

## Getting Started

Write your script in the main.c file

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
// Importing the self-made libs is like:
#include "include/array.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	int arrayLenght = 10;
	int array[arrayLenght];
	scanIntArray(array, arrayLenght); //from array.h
	printIntArray(array, arrayLenght); //from array.h
	return 0;
}
```

Now build with cmake

- Create a build folder.
```bash
$> mkdir build
```
- Open the folder.
```bash
$> cd build
```
- Run cmake.
```bash
$build> cmake ..
```
- Run make.
```bash
$build> make
```
- Execute the compiled project.
```bash
$build> ./main  
```

Complicated? If you are using Linux, you can simply run the _build.sh script in the root folder to build your project. Then use _make.sh and _run.sh to use your program.

```bash
$> ./_build.sh
$> ./_make.sh
$> ./_run.sh
```

## Creating your own libs and functions
You can create your own libraries with simple steps:

- Create the .c and .h files of your lib in the src folder (in our example we will create foo.h and foo.c)
- In the CmakeLists.txt file add your library the following way:
	- add_library(foo src/foo.c)
	- target_link_libraries(main foo)
- Add the lib header in the main
	- ```#include "src/foo.h" ```
